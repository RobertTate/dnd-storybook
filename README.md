# **D&D Storybook**

I recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons for the first time with some friends, and thought to myself, wouldn't it be cool if we had somewhere we could record our adventures after each session? I want to be able to look back years from now and remember the story of our characters journeys.

Thus, **D&D Storybook**. Currently under construction. 

This is not something you use while you play D&D. Rather, you and your crew come to your D&D storybook after the game, and record what happened in the session with as much flavor and RP goodness as desired.

Current Stack Choices:

- An Express app using Apollo Server to provide a GraphQL API.
- A MongoDB Atlas database, backing up that API.
- A React app served up by the Express server, and using Apollo Client.

All aspects of this little passion project are subject to change... including whether or not I finish it.
